                            Intrigued by the intricacies of software development led me to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Adelaide.
                            <br> <br>
                            During my undergraduate degree, I completed an internship at a software solutions company based in Malaysia. This granted me the opportunity to understand the ins and outs of software development. In addition to that, I undertook various courses that allowed me to explore the different facets of Computer Science such as cybersecurity, web development and data mining.
                            <br> <br>
                            I have always aspired to use my knowledge to enrich peoples' lives. With that, I plan on utilising the knowledge that I obtained throughout my Bachelor of Computer Science degree for the benefit of helping others.
                            <br> <br>
                            Here are a few technologies that I worked with during my Bachelor's degree:
